			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<hr>
			<img class="photoMe" src="assets/images/photo.png" alt="blank Image">
			<p class="textMiddleStuff">I am a native Houstonian who came to Austin about 4 years ago. Not having a clue what I wanted out of life, I started taking a few classes at the community college, even though I knew those credits wouldn't add up to a degree anytime soon. I never really did like school, I'm more of a jump right in and learn as you go type of person. I was working at a cookie store and I would play with codeacademy while I had downtime. My good friend was in a band at the time and jokingly asked me to make a webpage for them. It was quite crappy, but I did it! With how much I enjoyed the process and being able to get lost in something, I had a feeling that maybe I had found a path to go down, programming! <br><br>I did some more self study and eventually went to Austin Coding Academy for their beginner course. This pretty much just jammed HTML and CSS into my head for about two months with barley dipping our toe in the water with JavaScript. I knew that with only that class I wouldn't be able to get a job, but suprisingly I landed one as a Jr. Developer at MicroMain. It is a great foot in the door, but I still haven't touched any JavaScript or really anything that I am truly passionate about (We only use RAD tools really). Even tho I'm not passionate persay about the work I am doing currently, it is teaching me the basics of how the industry works, which I am grateful for. I am hoping that the coding bootcamp at UT will connect more dots in this huge puzzle called "programming". Side note about my life, I have an awesome boyfriend and pitbul/boxer puppy. </p>
